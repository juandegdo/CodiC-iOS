        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Medic Connect collects and uses your personal information, either directly or indirectly when you sign up for, and use Medic Connect, in any form, including the mobile application and/or website (the "Services"). Medic Connect receives your information through our mobile applications, website, email notifications, and any other interactions with our Services. When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, storage, use, disclosure and any other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize Medic Connect to use your information in the United States and any other country where Medic Connect operates.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

        <p>When you create a Medic Connect account, you must provide access credentials either in the form of an email address and password or via other social integration. You may optionally provide us with additional profile information, including a short biographical statement, geographical location, and profile picture or video. You may update or modify your profile information and contact information at any time. Profile information is available publicly on our Services, such as on your profile page.</p>

        <p>In addition to using your contact information to create your account, we may use this information periodically to contact you, or to send you information about our Services, respond to your requests and facilitate your use of the Services. We may use the contact information to help connect you with other Medic Connect users, even if that information is not publicly displayed. Some contact information may be required in order to use certain Services.</p>

        <p>Our Services include several features to help connect you with Friends through other services you know. For example, you may post information from your Medic Connect account to either Facebook, Twitter or Instagram. Medic Connect has provided this functionality in order to provide and improve the Services, for example, by making suggestions and even recommendations to others. When you connect your Medic Connect account to other services, you are giving permission to auto-post your Content to those services. You may disconnect your Medic Connect account from your account on the other services at any time. Disconnecting your Medic Connect account will immediately revoke our authorization to cross-post on your behalf or otherwise access that account and we will delete information obtained from that connection (other than information that was publicly posted on Medic Connect, such as profile information), which may take some time.</p>

        <p>Medic Connect is a video sharing platform of sorts, so most of the information you provide us is information that you choose to be made public. This includes not only the Content that you post and data provided with such Content, such as when it was posted, but also the accounts you follow, the Content that you like or comment on, and other public interactions on the Services. Your public information is broadly and instantly disseminated. For instance, your profile information and public Content are immediately delivered to a wide range of users and other services that access Medic Connect. When you share information or Content via the Services, you should think carefully about what you are making public.</p>

        <h2>Information Sharing and Disclosure</h2>

        <p>We may share or disclose your information at your direction, such as when you choose to publicly post a video or update your profile information. We engage service providers to perform functions and provide services to us in the United States and abroad. We may share your private personal information with such service providers subject to confidentiality obligations consistent with this Privacy Policy, and on the condition that the third parties use your private personal data only on our behalf and pursuant to our instructions.</p>

        <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Policy, we may preserve or disclose your information if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to comply with a law, regulation or legal request; to protect the safety of any person; to address fraud, security or technical issues; or to protect Medic Connect's rights or property. However, nothing in this Privacy Policy is intended to limit any legal defences or objections that you may have to a third party's, including a governments’, request to disclose your information.</p>

        <p>In the event that Medic Connect is involved in a bankruptcy, merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale of assets, your information may be sold or transferred as part of that transaction. The promises in this Privacy Policy will apply to your information as transferred to the new entity.</p>

        <p><b>Non-Private or Non-Personal Information:</b> We may share or disclose your non-private, aggregated or otherwise non-personal information, such as your public user profile information, public posts, the people you follow or that follow you, or the number of users who clicked on a particular link (even if only one did).</p>

        <h2>Modifying Your Personal Information</h2>

        <p>If you are a registered user of our Services, we provide you with tools and account settings to access or modify the profile information you provided to us and associated with your account.</p>
        <p>You can also permanently delete your Medic Connect account in settings.</p>

        <h2>Our Policy Towards Children</h2>

        <p>Our Services are not directed to persons under 13. If you become aware that your child has provided us with personal information without your consent, please <a href="https://radioishapp.com/support">Contact Us</a>. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. If we become aware that a child under 13 has provided us with personal information, we take steps to remove such information and terminate the child's account.</p>

        <h2>Changes to this Policy</h2>

        <p>We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at https://radioishapp.com/privacy.
