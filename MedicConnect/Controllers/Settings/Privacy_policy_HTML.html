			<p>Your privacy is important to Medic. We are very sensitive to the privacy needs of our supporting medical professionals and their patients and is wholly committed to maintaining privacy at the highest level. Medic does not sell or otherwise share any personal information with anyone. To better understand the way we collect, use, and store information, please review the our Privacy Policy below.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<h4> User Information</h4>
					<p>It is your choice whether or not you provide your Information to Medic, but specific user Information is required for Medic to provide you with services (for example, access to Medic under a user agreement). User information may be used internally within Medic in accordance with the Personal Information & Privacy Act (https://www.oipc.bc.ca/guidance-documents/1438). For example, Medic may use a medical professional’s personal and patient information internally to provide our services to our users, process your transactions, to contact you for customer service and billing purposes, and to communicate to you about your account or changes to our service.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Usage Information</h4>
					<p>Non-personally identifying information ("Usage Information") comprises information that does not identify any particular user. Examples include: information about which of Medic's features used (or website pages visited), mobile phone, browser type, operating system, or IP address. Your Usage Information may be disclosed internally within Medic and to third parties. For example, Medic may disclose Usage Information in order to better understand who and how users use our software (and website) in an attempt to improve our services, and for marketing, advertising, or research purposes.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Identifying Purposes</h4>
					<p>Only information that is directly related to provide our services is collected. Whenever a medical professional provides information to Medic, the client is consenting to the collection, use, and disclosure of that information in accordance with this Privacy Policy and PIPA Regulations and PIPA’s recommended “Best Practices”.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Consent</h4>
					<p>Medic will not automatically collect any information that specifically identifies you such as your name, address, or e-mail address. This information is collected only when you voluntarily provide it as part of the Sigh-up process and when creating an account. Patient identifiable information is only collected from medical professionals with their permission and it is never collected passively. Either a medical professional or patient may withdraw their consent for Medic to collect and/or store identifiable information at any time by notifying the Privacy Officer in writing.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Limiting Collection</h4>
					<p>The information that is collected is strictly limited to what Medic needs to provide medical consultation and transcription services to our users. However, Medic reserves the right to disclose your Information under limited circumstances in the event Medic believes that our software is being used to commit unlawful acts, and/or if disclosure of your user Information is required to comply with applicable laws or regulations, or with a court or administrative order.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Limiting Use, Disclosure, & Retention</h4>
					<p>Only those who “need to know” have access to patient sensitive information. This includes relevant physicians, associated medical personnel, medical transcriptionists, quality control personnel, the Technology Department, and technical support. Patient and Transcribed documentation is stored indefinitely on an encrypted server. All data is backed up daily and a copy is stored securely off-site.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Accuracy</h4>
					<p>We rely on our users to provide us with accurate patient and medical information. We do not perform any verification of patient identifiable information or other information as provided to us by our clients.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Safeguards</h4>
					<p>Medic has contracts with third party providers to ensure that they also protect the privacy of the information collected and that it is only used for the purposes for which it has been collected. All data is safeguarded with encryption and password protection on all computers, servers, restricted access areas and locked doors and alarms where appropriate. All systems are audited that process, transmit, and/or store patient data. Events to be audited may include, and are not limit ed to, logins, logouts, file access, deletions and modifications.</p>
					<p>Medic ensures that all workforce members are trained in and understand our security policies and procedures. In addition, all workforce members are trained how to identify, report, and prevent potential security incidents. Medic’s long term safeguards include regularly reviewing procedures, reviewing contractor policies on a regular basis, and regularly auditing policies, procedures, training, personnel, and systems.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<h4>Openness</h4>
					<p>All information collected is used only for the express purpose of providing medical consult and transcription services to our users.</p>
