        <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your access to and use of Medic Connect, including any Medic Connect mobile applications and websites (the "Services"), and any videos, information, text, graphics, photos or other materials uploaded, downloaded or appearing on the Services (collectively referred to as "Content"). Your access to and use of the Services is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. By accessing or using the Services you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <ol start="1" class="firstpar">
            <li style="font-size: 1.5em"><span style="font-size: 1.1em">Basic Terms</span></li>
        </ol>

        <p>You are responsible for your use of the Services, for any Content you post to the Services, and for any consequences thereof. The Content you submit, post, or display will be able to be viewed by other users of the Services and through third party services and websites. You should only provide Content that you are comfortable sharing with others under these Terms.</p>

        <p>You may use the Services only if you can form a binding contract with Medic Connect and are not a person barred from receiving services under the laws of the United States or other applicable jurisdiction. If you are accepting these Terms and using the Services on behalf of a company, organization, government, or other legal entity, you represent and warrant that you are authorized to do so. You may use the Services only in compliance with these Terms and all applicable local, state, national, and international laws, rules and regulations.</p>

        <p>The Services that Medic Connect provides are always evolving and the form and nature of the Services that Medic Connect provides may change from time to time without prior notice to you. In addition, Medic Connect may stop (permanently or temporarily) providing the Services (or any features within the Services) to you or to users generally and may not be able to provide you with prior notice. We also retain the right to create limits on use and storage at our sole discretion at any time without prior notice to you.</p>

As part of providing you the Services, we may need to provide you with certain communications, such as service announcements and administrative messages. These communications are considered part of the Services and your Medic Connect account, which you may not be able to opt-out from receiving.</p>

Each of the subsections below only applies up to the maximum extent permitted under applicable law. Some jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties or the limitation of liability in contracts, and as a result the contents of this section may not apply to you. Nothing in this section is intended to limit any rights you may have which may not be lawfully limited.</p>

            <p><b><em>A. The Services are Available "AS-IS"</b></em></p>

            <p>The Services may contain links to third-party websites or resources.

            </ol>

            <p><b><em>A. Waiver and Severability</em></b></p>

            <p>The failure of Medic Connect to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision. In the event that any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, then that provision will be limited or eliminated to the minimum extent necessary, and the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect.</p>

            <p><b><em>B. Controlling Law and Jurisdiction</em></b></p>

            <p>These Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the State of California without regard to or application of its conflict of law provisions or your state or country of residence.

            <p>If you are a federal, state, or local government entity in the United States using the Services in your official capacity and legally unable to accept the controlling law, jurisdiction or venue clauses above, then those clauses do not apply to you. For such U.S. federal government entities, these Terms and any action related thereto will be governed by the laws of the United States of America (without reference to conflict of laws) and, in the absence of federal law and to the extent permitted under federal law, the laws of the State of California (excluding choice of law).</p>

If the revision, in our sole discretion, is material we will notify you via email to the email associated with your account or through the Services.
